# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is off
# Paired-End mode is off

# tag size is determined as -1 bps
# total tags in treatment: 0
# d = 147
